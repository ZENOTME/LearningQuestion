Note for [How to read Paper](./howtoreadacspaper.pdf)

### The first pass ###

##### reading

- title, abstract, introduction
- section, sub-section headings
- conclusions
- references, ticking off the ones you've already read

##### You should answer the five Cs:

- Category: 
  - What type of paper is this ? 
  - What problem do this paper try to solve ?
  - What  main work do this paper do ?
- Context: 
  - What other papers is it related to ?
  - Which theoretical bases were used to analyze the problem ?
- Correctness:
  - Do the assumptions appear to be valid ?
- Contributions:
  - What are the paper's main contributions ?
- Clarity:
  - Is the paper well written ?

### The second pass

You should remember to mark relevant unread references for further reading (this is a good way to learn more about the background of the paper).

You should grasp the content of the paper.

You should be able to summarize the main thrust of the paper to someone else.

### The third pass

making the same assumptions as the authors, re-create the work. By comparing this re-creation with the actual paper, you can easily identify not only a paperâ€™s innovations, but also its hidden failings and assumptions.

At the end of this pass, you should be able to reconstruct the entire structure of the paper from memory, as well as be able to identify its strong and weak points.

### How to survey

1. find 3-5 recent paper in the area
2. do one pass on each paper and read their related work
3.  find shared citations and repeated author names in the bibliography
4. see where the key author published recently that help you identify the top conferences
5. look through these conferences
